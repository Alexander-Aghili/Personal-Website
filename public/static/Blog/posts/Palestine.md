I realized that writing my thoughts out in a coherent manner would be more beneficial because it could clarify my thoughts and make it difficult for people to misinterpret my position. I understand that support for Israel is a controversial position for Gen Z, given that support for Israel is at about 48% as compared to 80% for older generations. While the divide can be attributed to many factors, and I might touch on this component later, the focus on this is the current war and controversy within the Israel-Hamas conflict. The best way to illustrate why I support Israel is by working backwards from the result that, I think, we all seek. The result that we hope for, in an ideal world, is a two-state solution in which the people of Gaza are free from control by Israel, therefore self-sustaining, and the two nations live in peace. While there might be conflicts, they are handled diplomatically without violence. With this goal in mind, which isn’t the goal for all I might mention (I’m looking at you, “From the River to the Sea '' people), I provide the reasoning for which I justify the current actions of the Israeli government. I will reference an analogy that, while it is not perfect, I think is apt for the situation, and provides a framework for my rationale.

World War II was a destructive war that killed millions of soldiers and civilians across the world. A central component to that war is what is referred to as the Pacific theater. Here, the United States and Japan were fighting at sea and on the many islands littered throughout Oceania. What I think is important for the conversation about Israel is a specific look into essential relevant details at the time. The United States was pulled into the war after the unprovoked bombing of Pearl Harbor that resulted in two thousand U.S. soldiers and civilians. The purpose of the attack was to cripple the ability of the United States to wage war in the Pacific. However, the mission was unsuccessful as the United States went into full mobilization, mass producing weapons, aircraft carriers, and building special weapons. The Japanese were brutal, many Americans describing them as animals. They wouldn’t take war prisoners, they performed Kamikaze (suicide) attacks, and never surrendered any island until they were all dead. Throughout the years of war, America gained ground through island hopping campaigns until they were within flying distance to the mainland. America decided that they needed to cripple the ability for Japan to wage war and employ destruction to show the Japanese people and government the capabilities of America. Japan had little to no defense capabilities against America’s powerful weaponry. The United States employed a ruthless firebombing campaign against Tokyo, which resulted in the most dead civilians for one bombing target. It is estimated 300,000 Tokyo citizens died, 400,000 were injured, and one million people lost their homes. [Bombing of Toyko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo).

The bombings didn’t stop there. We, of course, dropped two nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing an estimated 200,000 people. [Nuclear Bombings](https://www.icanw.org/hiroshima_and_nagasaki_bombings#:~:text=By%20the%20end%20of%201945,person%20was%20loved%20by%20someone). There is no doubt that such activities are filled with controversy, [Debate Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki), as the deaths of civilians are always tragic. However, I’d argue that in a world of no absolutes, only trade offs, in the end the world was better off with these events. Indeed, America had no desire to kill civilians. Japanese civilians were warned before the bombings to evacuate through leaflets that America deployed. [Leaflets](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/ahf/key-documents/warning-leaflets/)

I think language is quite important. “Read this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. In the next few days, some or all of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. But, unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America’s humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives. America is not fighting the Japanese people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved the Japanese people. The peace which America will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better Japan. You can restore peace by demanding new and good leaders who will end the war. We cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked but some or all of them will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.”

I think these last few lines are quite apt for the current situation. One may argue that such warnings are blind to the reality of the situation, that all civilians can’t just leave and there will inevitably be casualties. It is estimated that if [Operation Downfall](https://www.history.navy.mil/about-us/leadership/director/directors-corner/h-grams/h-gram-057/h-057-1.html#:~:text=By%20late%20July%2C%20the%20JCS,to%2010%20million%20Japanese%20dead), the plan to invade mainland Japan, had gone through, the death toll would be 400-800,000 U.S. soldiers dead, and 5-10 Million Japanese soldiers and civilians dead.

There is no shortage of debate over the accuracy of this assessment and the questions of justification still remain, but it seems clear to me that a prolonged and violent war wouldn’t benefit anyone. Instead, Japan surrendered unconditionally to the United States in 1945 after the bombings. This is the beginning of a golden age for Japan. Americans developed a constitution and a stable government with strong rule of law, foreign capital and investment was introduced, and the Japanese became leaders in innovation. The conditions for Japanese civilians accelerated quickly to where the United States feared being overshadowed by the economic success of Japan in the 1980s. This is a story of rapid success for the Japanese people after a brutal and bloody war.

So why is this relevant to the palestinian question? This is because, while not exact, I think this provides the framing for what the success of the Palestinian people can be. We want the Palestinians to live a good life, one filled with prosperity, wealth, and health. There are many people who want to invest in Gaza and the West Bank with its young population, but can’t justify it as there lacks any authoritative government with a strong legal system, political stability, and low corruption. These investments would drastically improve the lives of young Palestinians, there is no doubt, and thus the structures to encourage such investment must be put into place. Just as America reformed the government of Japan after WW2, the west must do so for Gaza. 

This is where I mention Hamas. I believe that the blood of the civilians in Gaza is solely the responsibility of Hamas. Hamas has stolen billions, BILLIONS, of dollars worth of humanitarian aid from the Gazan people and used it to produce military tunnels and develop supply channels in said tunnels. They take water pipes out of the ground and create rockets with them. When Israel informed Gazan civilians of impending airstrikes, Hamas forced the civilians to remain in target buildings inevitably resulting in unnecessary death. When Israel provided water to southern Gaza in a bid to incentivize Gazan’s to move south and avoid bombings, Hamas would shoot any civilians who dare to make the trek. Hamas uses civilians as a shield, because for them, dead civilians is a good thing. It turns public opinion in their favor as people see the inevitable horrors of war. Israel, similar to the United States, drops leaflets in all the places they are about to bomb. If the Israelies truely didn’t care about civilians and wanted to commit a genocide, they could have done so long ago. Hamas wouldn’t hesitate to murder civilians, they’d kill the entire population of Israel if they could. Hamas has fired rockets into Israel for decades and Israel had just ignored it mostly using their Iron Dome system. No other country would let that stand. Why do we determine morality based on capability and not, at least partially, by intention? All of this world salad is to say, the true harm to the population of Gaza doesn’t come from Israel, but from Hamas. This doesn’t exclude the Netanyahu government from responsibility. It is known that Netanyahu actually funded Hamas, using them as a political tool to divide Palestine and increase his own power. Indeed, the blood of civilians in Israel and Palestine is partially on Netanyahu for emboldending and funding the terrorist opposition. However, the root of the issue remains the existence of Hamas itself, no matter the source of funding.

I believe, to provide prosperity for the Gaza population, Hamas must cease to exist. Civilians are inevitable collateral damage, but the reality is there are no absolutes, just trade offs, same as in Japan during WW2. A ceasefire, as many have called for, allows Hamas to resupply and regroup, while also not altering the status quo. If we wish to change the reality of the Middle East, we must allow Gaza and the West Bank to form governments whose aim is not the destruction of a neighboring state or the growth of their own. This cannot happen while a totalitarian terrorist organization remains in power. The development of such a government incentivizes investment, free trade, and will lead to a strong government which can work diplomatically with Israel. Unfortunately, it is clear to me that the subjugation of the Palestinian people is not the responsibility of Israel, but instead of their own corrupt and terroristic leaders. 
As such, I am hopeful for the destruction of Hamas, the redevelopment of Gaza, the establishment of a constitution and secular democratic government who may be stateless temporarily, and foreign investment into Gaza. For me, this will clearly create a strong case for a Palestinian state, one which has no incentive to destroy its neighbor, and a prosperous people. 

I’d also like to mention a few other things. This conflict seems to focus on Israel and Palestine directly. But it is clear to me that no side actually cares about the civilians of Palestine, not even the groups associated with them. The Arabian governments have no interest in taking refugees from Gaza despite their strong condemnation of Israel’s behavior. People talk of an open-air prison in Gaza while Egypt is directly on their Western border. Why do people not attack Egypt for keeping their border with Gaza tightly secured? (This is a genuine question) People also seem to focus on the conflict that receives the most media attention but do not care for civilians where there isn’t a seemingly clear side to protest against. The Yemen Conflict, a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, is estimated to have killed 150,000 civilians, including many poor women and children. Why does nobody seem to care about this? Post those childrens suffering? Where are the International calls on Iran and Saudi Arabia to stop funding the terrorist groups in Yemen? It is strange to me that this conflict is receiving so much attention. It might have something to do with ideas presented in this video, which I highly recommend you watch.

War is not pretty. Life is not easy. We’d like to be as simple as not killing civilians, but the circumstances prevent such a simple outlook. Sometimes one must be strong, tell the other side that they can and will annihilate their population, to bring them to the negotiation table. (Mutually Assured Destruction) We’d all like there to be no nuclear weapons and us all live in peace, but alas, it cannot be. I understand if one thinks that the route to peace in the Middle East is better off through a different route, through a ceasefire or other negotiation. If there are better opportunities that involve less destruction than I am all for that, but based on the history, the facts as they are, and the current outlook, I personally don’t see a better way forward than the model of Japan.

My views can and will likely change as I learn and see new things. I am always willing to discuss new information and differing viewpoints. Just don’t gather all your information from TikTok. I find this podcast with Sam Harris, who typically is left-leaning and a thought-provoking intellectual, to be informative yet unbaised.
