A few weeks ago, I was listening to the philosophical teachings of famous writer and speaker Alan Watts. 
You may have heard a few of his speeches online since they are everywhere in the motivational speaker side of Youtube. 
This channel, [TrueMeaning](https://www.youtube.com/c/TrueMeaning/") is entirely Alan Watt’s teachings, the very same channel I was listening to.

I became curious about the man and immediately ventured onto Wikipedia. 
There, I discovered that he died on Mount Tamalpais, the largest mountain in the county of Marin where I live, in some town called Druid Heights. 
I quickly realized that this was no ordinary town. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druid_Heights), Druid Heights was a bohemian community that spawned from famous poet Elsa Gidlow and was host to many influential artisans in the San Francisco counterculture era. 
However, the Federal government was able to take the land (Either by purchase or eminent domain) and incorporated it into the Golden Gate National Recreation Area during the 1970s. 
All but two of the buildings were abandoned and left to rot.

I decided that I would go explore this place, so I got up, called my friend, and off we went.
The exact address is 732 Camino del Canyon, but you can’t drive all the way there. 
Instead you have to park in a small lot on Muir Woods Rd right next to the entrance of Camino Del Canyon. 
From there, it is a 20 minute walk along the road until you reach the place. 
I used a map to try and navigate around the region, but it was difficult to identity the separate houses with the thick tree cover.
