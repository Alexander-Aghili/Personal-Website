A few weeks ago, I was listening to the philosophical teachings of famous writer and speaker Alan Watts. 
You may have heard a few of his speeches online since they are everywhere in the motivational speaker side of Youtube. 
This channel, [TrueMeaning](https://www.youtube.com/c/TrueMeaning/") is entirely Alan Wattâ€™s teachings, the very same channel I was listening to.
